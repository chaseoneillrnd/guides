# Comprehensive Task List Creation Rule

## Phase 1: Discovery & Context Gathering

Begin with practical probing questions to understand the initiative, then use socratic questioning to dive deeper based on the responses:

### Initial Probing

Ask a few simple, open-ended questions to establish baseline understanding:

- What is the goal or objective?
- What's the current situation that needs to change?
- What does success look like?

### Socratic Follow-up

Based on initial responses, ask clarifying questions that naturally emerge:

- Follow logical threads from their answers
- Probe assumptions and constraints
- Explore edge cases and dependencies
- Clarify scope boundaries and priorities
- Understand team context and preferences

Continue this questioning until you have comprehensive understanding of the technical, business, and team context.

## Phase 2: Context Validation

After gathering information through questioning:

- Review conversation history for relevant patterns and decisions
- Identify any gaps in understanding or missing details
- Confirm scope, constraints, and success criteria
- Validate technical approach and integration points

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Task Generation

Create a structured task list with the following organization:

### Phase Structure Requirements

- Document any completed work with tasks marked as [x]
- Structure each phase with mandatory sub-phases:
  1. **Before (Preparation)**: Analysis, planning, and test creation
  2. **During (Implementation)**: Core development work
  3. **After (Validation)**: Testing and verification
  4. **Cleanup (Finalization)**: Documentation and cleanup

### Task Description Standards

- Each task must contain complete, verbose descriptions preserving full context
- Include specific technical details, file paths, implementation approaches, and rationale
- When description limits are reached, create detailed subtasks to capture all context
- Include cross-references to conversation history and established patterns

### Final Validation Requirements

- Create comprehensive end-to-end validation task with extremely detailed description
- Document all integration points requiring validation
- Specify measurable acceptance criteria for each major component
- Include rollback procedures and monitoring requirements

### Context Preservation Standards

- Capture current state and completed work
- Document lessons learned, patterns, and architectural decisions
- Include technical debt items and future optimization opportunities
- Ensure each task can be understood and executed independently

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Start Simple**: Ask basic probing questions to understand the goal
2. **Follow Naturally**: Use socratic questioning based on their responses
3. **Validate Understanding**: Confirm all aspects before task creation
4. **Generate Detailed Tasks**: Create verbose, context-rich descriptions
5. **Ensure Completeness**: Verify no context is lost and tasks are actionable

This approach creates a comprehensive roadmap through natural conversation flow.
